        Ensure all dependencies (listed above) are available in your system.
    Clone the repository:


    git clone https://github.com/sharjith/ModelViewer-Qt.git
    cd ModelViewer-Qt

Create a build directory and configure the project using CMake:
    
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Build the project:

    make

Run the application:

    ./ModelViewer   

Windows

    Install vcpkg if not already installed. Follow the instructions here.
    Use vcpkg to install the required dependencies:

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/sharjith/ModelViewer-Qt.git
    cd ModelViewer-Qt

Create a build directory and configure the project using CMake with the vcpkg toolchain:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path_to_vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Replace [path_to_vcpkg] with the path to your vcpkg installation.
Build the project:

    cmake --build . --config Release

Run the application:

    .\Release\ModelViewer.exe

Additional Notes

    Replace the library versions with the latest ones, if applicable, but ensure compatibility with the project.
